                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                    I am a KBC student on MAN 1 JEMBER born on May 11, 2008, and the eldest child in my family. Being the firstborn has taught me to be responsible and independent from an early age. I have a strong interest in technology, and I enjoy spending my free time exploring various aspects of computers, from learning new software to understanding how they work. Apart from my love for technology, I am also passionate about staying active and engaging in sports. Badminton is one of my favorite activities, as it helps me stay fit and sharp while having fun. Cycling is another hobby I truly enjoy, allowing me to explore new places and feel connected to nature. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Additionally, I have a creative side that comes alive through photography. Capturing beautiful moments and sceneries through my camera gives me immense joy and satisfaction. These hobbies not only keep me engaged but also help me develop different skills and a well-rounded personality.</p>

                        <p class="Education">SD Al-Azhar 1 Bandar Lampung | 2014-2016</p>
                        <p>Starting school at SD Al-Azhar 1 Bandar Lampung was an exciting and memorable experience. On the first day, I was welcomed warmly by the teachers and staff, who guided me and my new friends through fun activities to get to know the school better. We explored the classrooms, playground, and other facilities, while learning about the rules and values of the school.</p>
                        <p class="Education">SDIT Adzkia 2 Padang | 2017-2020</p>
                        <p>Transferring to SDIT Adzkia Padang was a mix of excitement and nervousness for me. From the moment I arrived, the teachers and students were very welcoming, making it easier for me to adjust to the new environment.

                        <p>Starting my journey at SMPIT Adzkia Padang was both exciting and a bit nerve-wracking. On the first day, I was greeted with warm smiles from the teachers and my new classmates, which immediately made me feel welcome.

                        <p class="Education">SMPIT Al-Ikhlash Lumajang | 2022-2023</p>
                        <p>Transferring to SMP Al-Ikhlash Lumajang was a unique and challenging experience for me. Everything felt different at first—the school routines, teaching methods, and even the way my classmates interacted. It took me a while to adjust, but the teachers were patient and understanding, helping me feel more comfortable.</p>
                        <p>One of the biggest differences was how the school emphasized discipline and character-building alongside academics. The Islamic environment was a new experience for me, but I grew to appreciate the balance it brought to my daily life. My classmates were curious and welcoming, which made it easier to find friends despite our differences.</p>

                        <p>Although the workload was heavier than I was used to, I felt proud to be part of a program that values hard work and excellence. I’m excited to embrace this challenge and grow both academically and personally during my time at MAN 1 Jember.</p>
